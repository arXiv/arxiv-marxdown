The code in this repo was a poor use of resources given the many full
featured open source markdown to HTML projects. Converting the arXiv
help pages to markdown was valuable and the result of that work
continues to be used. We've moved to
[mkdocs-material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/). This
has worked well. It is a mature system with good documentation,
plugins and support from the author and a friendly community.
